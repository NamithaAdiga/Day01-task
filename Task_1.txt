DAY 1

1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1

1.HTTP1.1 Uses text commands to complete request response cycle.
2.HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
3.a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it.
4.HTTP1.1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.


HTTP2

1.HTTP2 Uses binary commands(0's and 1's) to execute request response cycle
2.HTTP/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection.This is the most advanced feature of the 
HTTP/2 protocol because it allows you to download web files This reduces additional round trip time (RTT), making your 
website load faster without any optimization
3.Efficient and robust in terms of processing of data between client and server.



2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
let school = {
name : “Vivekananda School”,
location : “Delhi”,
established : “1971”
}
